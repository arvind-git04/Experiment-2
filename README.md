## 2. List of the Experiments


### 🔹 Experiment 2.1 – Live Character Counter

#### **Aim**

To implement a live character counter that dynamically updates the character count as users type in a text area and restricts the input length to a predefined limit.

#### **Defined Approach**

In this experiment, a text area is created using HTML to accept user input. JavaScript is used to monitor user input in real time through the `keyup` event. As the user types, the length of the input text is calculated and displayed dynamically on the screen.

A maximum character limit is enforced to ensure controlled input. When the user exceeds the allowed limit, the text area is cleared and the counter is reset. CSS is used to design a simple and user-friendly interface. This experiment demonstrates real-time event handling and dynamic DOM manipulation.

#### **Learning Outcome**

- Understood real-time input handling using JavaScript events.
- Learned to implement character limits in text fields.
- Gained experience in DOM manipulation.
- Improved understanding of form validation techniques.

### 🔹 Experiment 2.2 – Dynamic Product Filter

#### **Aim**

To create a dynamic product filter that sorts and displays items based on category selection using a dropdown menu.

#### **Defined Approach**

This experiment focuses on building a product listing interface using HTML and CSS. Products are displayed in a card-based layout and categorized using predefined classes or data attributes.

A dropdown menu is provided to allow users to select a category. JavaScript is used to detect changes in the dropdown selection and filter the displayed products accordingly. Only products matching the selected category are shown, while others are hidden. This approach demonstrates dynamic content rendering using conditional logic.

#### **Learning Outcome**

- Learned to filter content dynamically using JavaScript.
- Gained understanding of dropdown-based user interaction.
- Improved skills in conditional logic and DOM updates.
- Developed responsive and interactive UI components.

### 🔹 Experiment 2.3 – Interactive SVG Drawing Tool

#### **Aim**

To build an interactive SVG drawing tool using mouse event handlers.

#### **Defined Approach**

In this experiment, an SVG canvas is created to allow users to draw freely using mouse interactions. JavaScript is used to track mouse events such as `mousedown`, `mousemove`, and `mouseup`.

When the user presses the mouse button, a new SVG path is created. As the mouse moves, the path is updated dynamically to simulate drawing. The drawing process stops when the mouse button is released. This experiment demonstrates the use of SVG elements and real-time graphics rendering.

#### **Learning Outcome**

- Learned to work with SVG elements in web applications.
- Understood mouse event handling in JavaScript.
- Gained experience in dynamic path generation.
- Improved understanding of interactive graphics programming.
